iFrame Opera Extension

This is a side little project that I create for Opera Extension. 
Usage: Preview any link in a pop-up frame without leaving current page, eliminating the need to go back to navigate to other links. Very useful for exploring Google search results, Craigslist, news feeds, etc. Also, search any text without leaving current page.
